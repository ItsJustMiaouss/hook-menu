# Hook Menu
 
 A Garry's Mod addon used to look into your server/client hooks, all in a simple menu!
 
 This is a small addon I made in a few hours to debug things.

# How to use

Just type ``hook_menu`` in your console. You must be a superadmin.

# Warning

It's not recommended to use this addon on your production server: searching for hooks on the server and client side is "extremely" resource intensive!
